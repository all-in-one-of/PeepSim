# PeepSim

A PBD technique based crowd simulation.

### Prepackaged Files

There is a Release Build already available at: `Projects\Release`. There is a hdnac file and a DLL. The DLL contains the code, the HDNAC is a digital asset that you can use.

To install this release package, you must copy the files to:

- DLL: `C:\Users\<Username>\Documents\houdini16.5\dso`
- HDNAC: `C:\Users\<Username>\Documents\houdini16.5\otls`

Once that is done, we can use the PeepSimulator Node in houdini which contains a pre-package set of nodes.

### Building

The Visual Studio files are present here. `Projects\plugin`

You might need to configure the Linker Directories and Compiler Include paths.


### Tutorial

Refer to the video we submitted. Once you have installed the plugin, you can use the video as a guide on how to create our custom nodes.
